# Suggestion Worker — easiest setup (~5 min, no CLI)

This optional Worker lets players submit spectrum suggestions **without ever touching
GitHub**. Until you set it up, the in-app button gracefully falls back to opening a
GitHub issue, so the game works fine with zero setup.

The Worker holds a GitHub token and, for each suggestion, **opens a pull request that
appends the pair to the `THEMES` deck** in `src/constants.js`. You just review the PR and
merge it if you like it — no extra steps. (Without the Worker, the in-app button opens a
prefilled issue and the repo's Action turns it into the same kind of PR.)

## 1. Create a token (1 min)
GitHub → **Settings → Developer settings → Fine-grained tokens → Generate new token**
- Repository access: **Only select repositories → `FrenchFive/Spectrum_Game`**
- Permissions:
  - **Contents → Read and write** (to commit the edited file on a branch)
  - **Pull requests → Read and write** (to open the PR)
- Generate, copy the token (`github_pat_…`).

## 2. Create the Worker (2 min, all in the browser)
Cloudflare dashboard → **Workers & Pages → Create**.
- On **"Select a method", choose "Start with Hello World!"** (the code-editor option).
  ⚠️ Do **NOT** pick *Upload assets* / *Import a repository* — those are for static sites
  and will reject the `.js` file ("does not support projects that require a build process").
- Name it (e.g. `spectrum-suggest`) → **Deploy**, then **Edit code**.
- Select-all and delete the starter code, paste the contents of
  [`spectrum-suggest.js`](./spectrum-suggest.js), then **Deploy**.
- **Settings → Variables and Secrets → Add**:
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN` = the token from step 1 — **mark it as a Secret (Encrypt)**.
  - *(optional)* `ALLOW_ORIGIN` = your game origin, e.g. `https://chanchanou.github.io` (defaults to `*`).
- Copy the Worker URL (e.g. `https://spectrum-suggest.chanchanou.workers.dev`).

## 3. Point the game at it (1 min, no code edit)
GitHub repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables → New variable**:
- `SUGGEST_ENDPOINT` = your Worker URL.

> ⚠️ Use the **full URL including `https://`** — a value like `spectrum-suggest.…workers.dev`
> without the scheme is treated as a relative path and the request hits GitHub Pages (405).

Re-run the Pages deploy (push any commit or trigger the workflow). Done — the in-app
"Suggest a spectrum" button now submits silently and a PR appears for you to merge.

## Prefer the CLI?
`wrangler.toml` is included. Run `npx wrangler deploy` then
`npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN`.
